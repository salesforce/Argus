Overview:

    The Argus client executor is designed to run as multiple instances across a
    cluster of compute resources performing asynchronous operations on behalf
    of one or more Argus servers.  Once invoked, the client will run until it
    is interrupted.

    If the client is configured as a COLLECT client, the client will poll for
    collection jobs to execute.  For each job that is dequeued, the executor
    will attempt to run the collection and enqueue metric and annotation data
    to be committed at a later time.

    If the client is configured as a SUBMIT client, the client will poll for
    metric and annotation data to dequeue and commit into persistent storage.

    If the client is configured as an ALERT client, the client will poll for
    alert jobs to execute.  For each job that is dequeued, the executor will
    evaluate the alert trigger conditions and if met, send notification.

Configuration:
    The client can be configured either by the use of system properties or by
    specifying the configuration in the command line arguments.  If the
    configuration is not specified in the command line arguments, then the
    configuration must be available via the system properties.

    The following properties specify paths to a global and local configuration
    file respectively.  Initially, global configuration is read if available.
    Local configuration is read next if available and is used to override the
    global configuration parameters.  Any configuration property that is not
    explicitly specified will use the system default.
